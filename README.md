# 2019S2-COMP9103-Assignment-PhoneBook
In this ECB program, it has 4 classes which are ECB, ContactProcessor, ContactHandler and Contact.
The ECB class has the main function.
In the Contact class, there are 5 instance fields, which is the name, address, email and birthday. All of those are belong to the String data type. Later, there are some methods to check the data forms.
In the ContactHandler class, the main purpose is fixing the input file's content (just phone book file). This class provides "add", "delete" and "query" function which will read from the instruction files.
The last one, the ContactProcessor helps this program to read the content and save it to the output file and report file.
Overall, this program finished all the required document except "test4". The programmer checked and debug it but still can't find the problem which is about "delete" function.
This may need further thinking.
